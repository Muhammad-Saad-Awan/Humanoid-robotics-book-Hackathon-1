# Robot Lab Options

This section outlines potential physical robot platforms that can be used for advanced labs and capstone projects. These options range from accessible quadruped robots to sophisticated humanoids, offering different levels of complexity and capability.

## Unitree Go2

*   **Type**: Quadruped Robot
*   **Price Range**: $2000 - $5000
*   **Capabilities**: Highly agile and dynamic, capable of walking, running, and traversing rough terrain. Offers good SDK support for ROS 2 integration, making it suitable for advanced navigation, locomotion, and perception tasks.
*   **Limitations**: Not a humanoid robot, so direct application to humanoid-specific challenges (e.g., bipedal balancing) may be limited. Requires significant programming effort for complex tasks.
*   **Required OS/Drivers**: Linux (Ubuntu recommended), ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Unitree SDK.
*   **Compatible Modules**: Excellent for Module 1 (ROS 2), Module 3 (AI for perception/navigation), and can be adapted for aspects of Module 4 (e.g., VLA for command-and-control).

## Unitree G1 (Humanoid)

*   **Type**: Humanoid Robot (Lite version)
*   **Price Range**: $8,000 - $15,000+ (estimate, actual pricing may vary)
*   **Capabilities**: A more advanced humanoid platform designed for research and development. Capable of bipedal locomotion, basic manipulation, and complex AI integration. Offers a more direct path to working with humanoid-specific challenges.
*   **Limitations**: High cost, likely requires dedicated lab space and expert support. Advanced manipulation and dynamic balancing may still be research-level.
*   **Required OS/Drivers**: Linux (Ubuntu recommended), ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Unitree G1 SDK.
*   **Compatible Modules**: Directly relevant for all modules, especially Module 1 (ROS 2), Module 3 (AI Brain), Module 4 (VLA for advanced control), and the final capstone project.

## Other Humanoid Options (e.g., OP3, TonyPi)

*   **Type**: Humanoid Robots
*   **Price Range**: Varies significantly ($10,000 - $50,000+)
*   **Capabilities**: These platforms are typically designed for advanced research in bipedal locomotion, human-robot interaction, and complex manipulation. They offer high degrees of freedom and sophisticated control systems.
*   **Limitations**: Very high cost, accessibility limited to well-funded labs. May require specialized expertise for operation and integration.
*   **Required OS/Drivers**: Varies by manufacturer, often Linux-based with custom SDKs and ROS integration.
*   **Compatible Modules**: Highly relevant for all modules, especially advanced topics in Modules 1, 3, 4, and the capstone.

**Note**: Specific models and pricing are subject to change. Always consult the manufacturer for the latest specifications and availability. These platforms assume a prerequisite understanding of ROS 2, AI, and robotics principles covered in the earlier modules.
