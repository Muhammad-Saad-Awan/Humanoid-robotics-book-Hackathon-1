# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and acronyms used in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It takes energy and converts it into some kind of motion.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

**AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot)**: A robot that can understand and navigate its environment without direct human supervision.

## D

**DH Parameters (Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters)**: A conventional notation for representing the geometry of robotic manipulators.

**Digital Twin**: A virtual model of a physical object or system.

## I

**IK (Inverse Kinematics)**: The process of determining the parameters of a jointed flexible object (such as a robot arm) in order to achieve a desired pose (position and orientation) for a end-effector.

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and often magnetometers.

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's scalable robotics simulation application and development platform.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence program that can recognize and generate text and other content, summarize documents, translate languages, and engage in realistic conversation.

## N

**Nav2**: The ROS 2 Navigation Stack, providing algorithms and tools for robot navigation.

**Node (ROS 2)**: An executable process that performs a specific task within the ROS 2 graph.

## O

**Occupancy Grid**: A map representation commonly used in robotics, where the environment is divided into a grid and each cell stores the probability of being occupied by an obstacle.

## P

**Perception Pipeline**: A series of computational steps that process raw sensor data to extract meaningful information about the environment, such as object detection, tracking, and scene understanding.

**PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Controller**: A control loop mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.

**Proprioceptive Sensors**: Sensors that provide feedback about the internal state of the robot, such as joint angles, motor speeds, and forces.

## R

**RealSense**: A line of depth-sensing cameras from Intel.

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source, meta-operating system for robots.

## S

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while at the same time keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## T

**TF2 (Transform Frame 2)**: A ROS 2 package that keeps track of multiple coordinate frames and allows for transformations between them.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format for describing all aspects of a robot.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A framework enabling robots to understand natural language instructions, perceive their environment through vision, and execute physical actions.
